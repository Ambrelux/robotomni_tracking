# Robot omni tracking and controller part

This Project is a Tkinter application with an UDP server used to send commands to the OmnibotSimulation and display the robot view. 

The algorithms used are Yolov3 for detection and trackerMOSSE for tracking. The current solution for detection and tracking is developped to be efficient and reliable even with low computing capacity
